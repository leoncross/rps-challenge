## Development Approach

The user stories were simple - add the functionality to have a 'name' and then be able to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The bonus challenge of having this be multiplayer, as well as further increasing it from rps-3 to rps-5 (including Spock and Lizard options).

I mapped out my approach, with a focus on the user stories and bonus challenges. In my design, I started on a simple one player, rps-3 design, but ensured that this was able to  be simply scaled up for heightened functionality. Once completed, I reformatted. This was heavily focused on Test Driven Development.
